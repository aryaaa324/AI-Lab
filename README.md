# 📌 Project Aims
# 🔹 Graph Traversal Algorithms
## 1️⃣ Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a given dataset

### 🔹 Concept  
- BFS is a level-wise traversal technique.  
- It explores all nodes at the current depth before moving deeper.  
- Uses a queue (FIFO - First In, First Out) to process nodes in the order they were discovered.  

### 🔹 Algorithm  
- Initialize an empty queue and a visited set.  
- Add the starting node to the queue and mark it as visited.  
- While the queue is not empty:  
  - Dequeue a node and process it.  
  - Add all its unvisited neighbors to the queue and mark them as visited.  
- Repeat until all reachable nodes are visited.  



## 2️⃣ Implement Depth-First Search (DFS) on a given dataset

### 🔹 Concept  
- DFS is a traversal technique that explores as **deep as possible** before backtracking.  
- It follows a **recursive approach** or uses an **explicit stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)**.  
- DFS is useful for solving problems like **maze traversal, cycle detection, and topological sorting**.  

### 🔹 Algorithm  
- Initialize an empty **stack** (or use recursion) and a **visited set**.  
- Add the **starting node** to the stack and mark it as visited.  
- While the stack is **not empty**:  
  - Pop a node from the stack and process it.  
  - Add all its **unvisited neighbors** to the stack and mark them as visited.  
- Repeat until all reachable nodes are visited.
